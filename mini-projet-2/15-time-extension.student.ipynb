    "When facing a partially observable environment, training with RL a reactive agent which just selects an action based on the current observation\n",
    "is not guaranteed to reach optimality. An option to mitigate this fundamental limitation is to equip the agent with a memory of the past.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to do so is to use a recurrent neural network instead of a feedforward one to implement the agent: the neural network contains\n",
    "some memory capacity and the RL process may tune this internal memory so as to remember exactly what is necessary from the\n",
    "past observation. This has been done many times using an LSTM, see for instance \n",
    "[this early paper](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2001/file/a38b16173474ba8b1a95bcbc30d3b8a5-Paper.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to do so is to equip the agent with a list-like memory of the past observations \n",
    "and to extend the critic and policy to take as input the current observation and the previous ones.\n",
    "This removes the difficulty of learning an adequate representation of the past, but this results in \n",
    "enlarging the input size of the actor and critic networks. This can only be done if the required memory\n",
    "horizon to behave optimally is small enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of the CartPoleContinuous-v1 environment, one can see immediately that a memory of the previous\n",
    "observation is enough to compensate for the absence of the derivative features, since $\\dot{a} \\approx (a_{t} - a_{t-1})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we will extend the RL agent with a memory of size 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though it may not be intuitive at first glance, the simplest way to do so is to embed the environment into a wrapper\n",
    "which contains the required memory and produces the extended observations. This way, the RL agent will naturally be built\n",
